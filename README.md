# RIsearch1 (tauso fork)

RIsearch1: RNA–RNA, RNA-DNA and DNA-DNA interaction prediction using a simplified
nearest-neighbor energy model.

This fork carries **RIsearch1 only**. RIsearch2 and the siRNA off-target pipeline
live upstream at [RTH-tools/risearch](https://github.com/RTH-tools/risearch); they
were removed here because nothing downstream of this fork uses them. Their history
is still in this repository if you need it.

## Python package

A precompiled binary from this fork is published to PyPI as `risearch-tauso`, so
RIsearch is a normal Python dependency for tauso and any other downstream tool:

```bash
pip install risearch-tauso
```

```python
import risearch_tauso, subprocess
subprocess.run([risearch_tauso.executable_path(), "-q", "query.fa", "-t", "target.fa"])
```

Or as a CLI shim, which forwards all arguments straight to the bundled binary:

```bash
risearch-tauso -q query.fa -t target.fa
python -m risearch_tauso -q query.fa -t target.fa
```

The PyPI package is **not** canonical upstream RIsearch — it is the tauso-team
fork. Use upstream if you want the unmodified tool.

## Building from source

Requires a C++17 compiler and CMake 3.20 or newer.

```bash
cmake -S RIsearch1 -B RIsearch1/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build RIsearch1/build -j
```

That produces `RIsearch1/bin/RIsearch` and `RIsearch1/bin/RIsearch.dbg`, the
second with the debug tracing compiled in. The wheel build runs the same CMake via
`setup.py`.

## Tests

```bash
./RIsearch1/build/tests/risearch1_tests
```

Unit tests for the nucleotide coding, the min/max helpers, the alignment symbols,
the energy matrix and the FASTA reader; end-to-end tests that run `main()` in
process with a constructed argv and assert on its output. Pass
`-DRISEARCH_BUILD_TESTS=OFF` to skip googletest entirely, as the wheel build does.

## Running

```bash
RIsearch -q query.fa -t target.fa
```

Both files may hold several sequences; RIsearch scans all against all. Single
sequences can be given directly with `-Q acgu -T acgu`. See `RIsearch1/Manual.pdf`
for the full option list.
